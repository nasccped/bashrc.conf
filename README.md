bashrc config
=============

Here is my `.bashrc` configurations!

Clone repo and move files can be borigin a lot, so you can just
**copy** and **paste** the file content instead.

All necessary content will be disposed at `src/.bashrc`. Just copy
it to your local `.bashrc` (probably located in your _home/USERNAME_
path). [Git program][git-link] will be necessary!
